## C++ OOP Problems Practice

This repository contains solutions to various C++ Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) problems that I have practiced during my learning journey in C++.

### About Me

My name is **Muhammad Hamza**, and I am a computer science student passionate about learning programming, particularly C++. This repository showcases my progress and helps me reinforce concepts related to OOP in C++.

## Problems Solved

The repository includes solutions to the following types of problems:

- **Classes and Objects**: These problems focus on defining and instantiating classes and objects. It involves creating classes to model real-world entities, understanding constructors, destructors, and member functions to interact with objects.

- **Inheritance**: Problems under this category deal with the concept of inheritance in C++. It includes both single and multiple inheritance, demonstrating how derived classes inherit properties and behaviors from base classes to promote code reuse and hierarchical relationships.

- **Polymorphism**: This category covers solving problems that use function overriding and runtime polymorphism. It allows one interface to be used for different data types, enabling dynamic behavior at runtime through virtual functions.

- **Encapsulation and Abstraction**: These problems involve hiding implementation details and exposing only essential information to users. By using private and protected data members along with getter and setter functions, I practiced designing classes that enforce data integrity and abstraction.

- **File Handling**: These problems teach how to work with files in C++, including reading from and writing to text and binary files. The focus is on manipulating file streams to store and retrieve data efficiently.

### Setup and Usage

To run the code in this repository:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cpp-oops-practice.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd cpp-oops-practice
   ```

3. Compile the code using a C++ compiler like g++:
   ```bash
   g++ -o program program.cpp
   ```

4. Run the compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./program
   ```
